# GonioTests

## Gopolarimetric Testing Library

This software library is intended to be used for testing goniopolarimetric
measurement devices, using a given set of effective antenna parameters.

## History

The present library has been developed for the Cassini/RPWS instrument, by B. 
Cecconi in 2002, at the same time the goniopolarimetric analyses were developed
for this instrument. More info are available in Cecconi and Zarka [2005] and 
Cecconi [2007]. The library has also been used for the STEREO/Waves instrument, 
and the study of the JUICE/RPWI radio receiver. 

## Library language 

The current software is provided in IDL language, but the short term goal is to 
have a python version available.
